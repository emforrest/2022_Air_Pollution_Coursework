## My Programming module coursework, to analyse data on air pollution levels in areas of London

In Term 1 of my first year at university, I was assigned coursework for the Programming module, which constituted 100% of the mark for this module. 

The coursework was focussed on analysing air pollution data collected from different districts in London using Python. It was split into three parts: the Pollution Reporting module, which calculates statistics such as daily average levels of one of three pollutants at one of three stations; the Mobility Intelligence module, which took in an image of a road map and processed its colours and connected components, and the Real-time Monitoring module, which scraped real-time pollution data from the London Air API and allowed the user to see the levels of one pollutant at each station, the levels of each pollutant at one station, the current health recommendations for a specific pollutant and station, or compare the levels of a pollutant at two monitoring stations. 

In this repository are the five program files and the testing file I was required to create, as well as the provided datasets. 

*Note: in monitoring.py, the function get_live_data_from_api() was provided by the module leaders, and isn't actually used in my finished project.

I achieved a mark of 96/100 for this coursework.
